"""
    In this program, we first get the input from the user using the input() function and convert the input to floating-point numbers using the float() function. We then calculate the simple interest using the formula (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period in years. Finally, we print the result using the print() function.

    You can further enhance this program by adding error handling, formatting the output, or allowing the user to choose between calculating the simple interest or the final amount.
