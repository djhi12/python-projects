if num % 2 == 0:
    # If the number is even, print a message and double the number
    print("The number is even.")

# This program asks the user for an input number, checks if it is even using the modulus operator (%) and the logical operator (==), and then either doubles the number or adds 1 to it depending on whether it is even or odd. Finally, it prints out the final value of the number.
