Loan Payment Calculation: Implement a function that calculates the monthly loan payment based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.

Amortization Schedule: Create a function that generates an amortization schedule, displaying the payment breakdown for each month, including the principal and interest portions.

Loan Comparison: Allow users to compare different loan options by inputting multiple loan parameters and displaying a comparison of monthly payments and total interest paid.

Early Repayment Analysis: Enable users to explore the impact of making additional payments or early loan repayments on the loan term and interest savings.

Loan Affordability: Incorporate a feature where users can input their monthly income and expenses to determine the maximum loan amount they can afford, considering a specific debt-to-income ratio.

Interest Rate Conversion: Develop a function that converts the annual interest rate to a monthly or daily rate, depending on the user's preference.

Currency and Date Formatting: Add functionality to format currency values and dates appropriately based on the user's location or preferences.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to handle invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user.
