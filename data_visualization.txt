"""
Python offers several powerful libraries for data visualization, making it a popular choice among data scientists and analysts. Here are some of the most commonly used libraries for data visualization in Python:

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library that provides a high-level interface for creating a variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It offers a wide range of plot types and customization options.

Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations such as heatmaps, categorical plots, and time series plots.

Plotly: Plotly is a versatile library that supports interactive visualizations and offers APIs for Python, R, JavaScript, and other programming languages. It provides a wide range of chart types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, and 3D visualizations.

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data analysis library in Python, but it also offers basic data visualization capabilities. It integrates with Matplotlib and provides a convenient way to create plots directly from pandas data structures, such as DataFrames and Series.

Bokeh: Bokeh is a library specifically designed for creating interactive visualizations in web browsers. It provides an elegant and concise syntax for building interactive plots, dashboards, and applications that can be deployed online.

Altair: Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library that allows you to build a wide range of visualizations with a compact and expressive syntax. It leverages the Vega-Lite visualization grammar and provides interactivity by default.

ggplot: ggplot is a Python implementation of the popular ggplot2 library in R. It follows the grammar of graphics concept, allowing you to create complex visualizations by combining different graphical elements.

These libraries offer a range of capabilities, from basic plots to advanced interactive visualizations. Depending on your specific needs and preferences, you can choose the library that best suits your requirements.
