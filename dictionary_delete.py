"""
In this updated version of the program, we've added a new function called delete_word(). When the user selects option 4, the program prompts them to enter a word to delete. If the word is in the dictionary, the program deletes it using the del dictionary[word] syntax.

I hope this updated program helps you add the "Allow users to delete words and their meanings from the dictionary" feature to your own dictionary project!
