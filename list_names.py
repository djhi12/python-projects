# One possible Python project that makes use of the filter() function is a program that filters a list of strings based on a specific condition. Here's an example program that filters a list of names based on whether they start with a certain letter:


names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Gabriel', 'Harley', 'Inigo', 'James', 'Kelly', 'Leo', 'Michael', 'Neo', 'Omni', 'Parker', 'Quad', 'Rose', 'Stan', 'Tanya', 'Uvo', 'Vince', 'Walter', 'Xian', 'Yin', 'Zab']

def filter_names(starting_letter):
    return list(filter(lambda name: name.startswith(starting_letter), names))

starting_letter = input("\nType the starting letter: ")
filtered_names = filter_names(starting_letter.upper())

print(filtered_names, "\n")

"""
    In this example, the filter_names() function takes a single argument, starting_letter, which specifies the letter that we want to filter the list of names by. We use the lambda keyword to define an anonymous function that checks whether each name in the list starts with the specified letter. We then pass this function to the filter() function along with the list of names.

    The filter() function applies the lambda function to each element of the list and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the lambda function returns True.

    Finally, we call the filter_names() function with the argument 'C' to filter the list of names and print out the resulting filtered list.

    You can modify this example program to filter a different list of strings based on a different condition, depending on your specific project requirements.
